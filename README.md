### Blue Wrapper, Version 2 â€“ React.js & web redesign

This is a very ambitious project which intends to revamp the current iteration of the Blue Wrapper.

Thoughtful consideration was made on whether such update should be made, and it was ultimately decided that using a library to render the DOM would be scalable in the long run.

The [original version](https://github.com/Amazingca/BSKY-Wrapper-v1) of the Blue Wrapper is now archived and will remain available for legacy purposes.

<!--### Some final words

The Blue Wrapper was not a project I thought I would continue working on. At the time I started building it in Febuary, it was originally my intention to view basic information and posts, but nothing on the scale as it has come to.

However, the response I've received has given me reason to continue adding and refining features which set it apart. I am deeply grateful for those who continue to support it.-->
